# GPU Components Research: Gold Content

## Do GPUs Contain Gold?

Yes. GPUs contain small (microscopic) amounts of gold as a functional material
in several key areas.

## Where Gold Is Used in GPUs

- **Connectors and edge fingers** — Gold plating on the PCIe connector fingers
  provides corrosion-resistant, low-loss electrical contact with the motherboard
  slot. This is the highest concentration of gold on a typical graphics card.
- **Bonding wires** — Solid gold bonding wire connects the silicon die to the
  IC package inside the GPU chip.
- **Substrate and solder balls** — Small amounts of gold are present in the BGA
  (ball grid array) substrate and solder connections.
- **Pins and lead frames** — Gold plating on package leads and land pads
  improves connection reliability.

## Why Gold Is Used

- Resists corrosion and oxidation, maintaining reliable connections over time
- Excellent and consistent electrical conductivity
- Withstands repeated thermal cycling
- Forms reliable bonds at microscopic scales

No alternative material matches gold's complete reliability profile for these
applications.

## Quantity

A typical consumer GPU contains a fraction of a gram of gold. An entire
computer (CPU, RAM, GPU, motherboard) is estimated to contain roughly 1/5th of
a gram. Extracting gold from individual cards is not economically viable.

## Other Precious Metals in GPUs

- **Silver** — circuit board traces and some capacitors
- **Palladium** — multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and some solder
- **Copper** — primary conductor in PCB traces and heatsinks
- **Platinum group metals** — small quantities in specialized components
